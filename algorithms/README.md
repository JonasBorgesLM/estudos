# Algorithms in Go

Welcome to the **Algorithms in Go** repository! This project contains implementations of various algorithms in Go, aiming to provide a solid foundation for exploring and implementing diverse algorithms and data structures.

## Function Descriptions

### 1. BinarySearch

The `BinarySearch` function implements the binary search algorithm to find an integer in a sorted array.

- **Efficient Search**: Quickly locates an element in a sorted array.
- **Index Return**: Returns the index of the first occurrence of the found element.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles errors for empty arrays and elements not found.

### 2. SelectionSort

The `SelectionSort` function implements the selection sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.

- **In-Place Sorting**: Sorts the array without using additional space.
- **Stable Sorting**: Maintains the relative order of equal elements.
- **Time Complexity**: Operates in O(nÂ²) time complexity, making it less efficient on large lists.
